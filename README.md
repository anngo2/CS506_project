### Description of Project ###

As a young student finding your first off-campus housing is quite a daunting challenge and with Warren Towers under renovation, we take this opportunity to analyze and inform on the transparency and accountability of off-campus student housing. Through this project, we seek to first find a cluster of locations with dense student populations to allow us to study the condition under which students are allowed to pursue their education. The project will progress under a collaborative environment with the Inspectional Services Department to restore and clarify housing violation data, develop tools to identify problematic landlords, and integrate data across city departments. 

### Goal of Porject ###

Under the BuSpark ensign, this projects seeks to be rich in information extraction, pattern recogniztion, and, most importatnly, a helpful tool in guiding students to make more informative decsions on housing contracts. 

### Data Collection ###

A good start to the collection of data is avaliable on the Spart project word doc, https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bo8HOm5KWv1h1UqtTZ7QCV4YYtyfKhN9KFHLL5j0MJo/edit?tab=t.0. In addition, more research is going to be put into scraping for publicly avaliable datasets related to housing which contain student and land-lord informations. 

#### Midterm Report ####

### Data Analysis - ###

Analysis of the data will take 2 different approaches as highlighted below. 

1) Descriptive Analysis: In this we will first be analysing the general trend such as percentage of student housing occupation per district over time, changes in student rental market, identifying dense student housing locations, and student housing dynamics. The second state of the descriptive Analysis is to analyse Violent and complaint stats such as number of violation, types of violations, frequency of violations, and lastly response timings.
2) Inferential and Predictive Analysis: In this phase we will use the descriptive analysis to futher our study to make real time prediction on features like identifying bad landlords, predicting liklihood of non-compliance, clustering non-compliant landlords, as well as the affordability and any violations. 


### Data Visualization ###

For visualizing and reporting we will try to implemtn the following: 

1) Time series of student housing percentage by district
2) Bar Charts of studnet violations
3) Heatmaps of violent density
4) Cluster analysis of bad landlords
5) Property value trends over time
6) Comparisons between student occupancy and violations levels

We will also provide summaries and potentially if time allows a custom fine-tuned NLP to the data that can help with queries regarding housing. 


### Test Train Validate ###

For the predictive analysis we will be using the 7-fold cross-validate method which basically runs the model over multiple iterations each time with different partiions to get better reporting on the predictions. Futher research will be needed to properly test our models and report.
